### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Arundhati Menon. I am a hard-working and confident individual and believe in collaborating with teammates to complete tasks by leading them through an example. I am patient and punctual and conclude all assignments before the allotted deadline. As a former NCC cadet, I have a natural leading ability and confidence that set me apart from the rest of my colleagues. My penmanship is immensely refined and cultivated as I have written numerous poems, which have helped polish my vocabulary and oratory skills.
## My Education
- Alumna of St.Joseph's Convent School, Idgah Hills, Bhopal
- Currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering with Specialization in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics from Vellore Institue of Technology, Bhopal
